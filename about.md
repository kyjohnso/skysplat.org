# About SkySplat

SkySplat is an open-source initiative dedicated to making **3D Gaussian Splatting** technology accessible to artists, researchers, and developers worldwide. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge 3DGS research and practical creative tools.

## What is 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a revolutionary technique for real-time rendering of photorealistic 3D scenes. Unlike traditional polygon-based rendering, 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian functions, enabling:

- **Real-time performance** with photorealistic quality
- **Novel view synthesis** from sparse input views
- **Efficient storage** and streaming capabilities
- **Seamless integration** with existing 3D pipelines

## Our Projects

### SkySplat Blender
Our flagship project is a comprehensive Blender addon that brings 3DGS capabilities directly into the world's most popular open-source 3D software. Features include:

- Native .ply and 3DGS format support
- Real-time viewport visualization
- Advanced editing and manipulation tools
- Seamless workflow integration

### Future Projects
We're actively developing additional tools and resources:

- **SkySplat CLI** - Command-line tools for 3DGS processing
- **SkySplat Web** - Browser-based 3DGS viewer and editor
- **Research Tools** - Utilities for 3DGS research and experimentation

## Community

SkySplat is built by and for the community. We believe in:

- **Open Source** - All our tools are freely available under permissive licenses
- **Collaboration** - We welcome contributions from developers, artists, and researchers
- **Education** - Sharing knowledge through documentation, tutorials, and articles
- **Innovation** - Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with 3DGS technology
