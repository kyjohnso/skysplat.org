# Welcome to SkySplat!

We're excited to announce the launch of **SkySplat**, an open-source initiative dedicated to making 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technology accessible to artists, researchers, and developers worldwide.

## What is SkySplat?

SkySplat is more than just a tool - it's a comprehensive ecosystem for working with 3D Gaussian Splatting data. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge 3DGS research and practical creative applications.

### Our Flagship Project: SkySplat Blender

Our main focus is the **SkySplat Blender addon**, which brings native 3DGS support directly into Blender. This means you can:

- Load video and extract frames
- Configure and run COLMAP for Structure from Motion
- Import and modify the COLMAP point cloud and cameras
- Export the COLMAP model, and
- Configure and Run [Brush](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush) 

All from the Blender 3D Viewport.

## Why 3D Gaussian Splatting?

If you haven't heard of 3D Gaussian Splatting yet, you're in for a treat! This revolutionary rendering technique offers:

- **Photorealistic quality** with real-time performance
- **Novel view synthesis** from sparse camera inputs
- **Efficient storage** and streaming capabilities
- **Natural handling** of complex lighting and materials

Unlike traditional polygon-based rendering, 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian functions, enabling unprecedented quality and performance for certain types of content.

## Why Blender

The [Blender](https://blender.org) Community is inclusive, cooperative, open, and innovative and the Blender software provides a universal 3D modeling, animation, simulation, and visualization toolset. Blender geometry nodes, shader nodes, modifiers, and integration with other data sets makes it a wonderful playground in which to experiment with 3DGS.
