## About 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting is a revolutionary technique for real-time rendering of photorealistic 3D scenes. Unlike traditional mesh-based approaches, 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian functions, enabling:

- **Ultra-fast rendering** with real-time performance
- **Photorealistic quality** from novel viewpoints  
- **Efficient storage** and transmission
- **Easy integration** with existing 3D pipelines
