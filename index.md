## What is 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)?

3D Gaussian Splatting is a revolutionary neural rendering technique for creating photorealistic 3D scenes in real-time. Unlike traditional polygon mesh rendering or NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields), 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling:

- **Real-time Rendering**: Achieve 60+ FPS with photorealistic quality
- **Novel View Synthesis**: Generate new camera angles from sparse input views
- **Drone-Friendly**: Perfect for aerial photogrammetry and drone mapping
- **Blender Integration**: Seamless workflow with industry-standard 3D software
- **Efficient Storage**: Compact representation compared to traditional meshes
- **COLMAP Compatible**: Works with standard structure-from-motion pipelines

## Getting Started with 3DGS in Blender

1. **Install SkySplat Blender** - Download the addon and set up your environment
2. **Process Drone Footage** - Import video, extract frames, and run COLMAP
3. **Train 3DGS Models** - Use Brush to create Gaussian splatting representations
4. **Explore Tutorials** - Learn advanced techniques and workflows
5. **Join the Community** - Share your work and get support

### Perfect For:
- **Drone Operators**: Convert aerial footage into 3D models
- **3D Artists**: Create photorealistic environments in Blender
- **Researchers**: Experiment with Gaussian splatting technology
- **Photographers**: Transform photo sets into interactive 3D scenes
