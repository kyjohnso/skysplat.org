We're excited to announce the launch of **SkySplat**, an open-source initiative dedicated to making 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technology accessible to artists, researchers, and developers worldwide.

## What is SkySplat?

SkySplat is more than just a tool - it's a comprehensive ecosystem for working with 3D Gaussian Splatting data. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge 3DGS research and practical creative applications.

### Our Flagship Project: SkySplat Blender

Our main focus is the **SkySplat Blender addon**, which brings native 3DGS support directly into Blender. This means you can:

- **Import and visualize** .ply and other 3DGS formats
- **Edit and manipulate** Gaussian splat data in real-time
- **Integrate seamlessly** with your existing Blender workflows
- **Export optimized** 3DGS data for web and real-time applications

## Why 3D Gaussian Splatting?

If you haven't heard of 3D Gaussian Splatting yet, you're in for a treat! This revolutionary rendering technique offers:

- **Photorealistic quality** with real-time performance
- **Novel view synthesis** from sparse camera inputs
- **Efficient storage** and streaming capabilities
- **Natural handling** of complex lighting and materials

Unlike traditional polygon-based rendering, 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian functions, enabling unprecedented quality and performance for certain types of content.
