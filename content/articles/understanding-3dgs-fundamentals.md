A comprehensive introduction to the mathematical foundations and core concepts behind 3D Gaussian Splatting technology.

<!-- more -->

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a paradigm shift in how we approach real-time rendering of photorealistic 3D scenes. This article explores the mathematical foundations and core concepts that make this technology so powerful.

## What Makes 3DGS Different?

Traditional 3D rendering relies on polygonal meshes and complex lighting calculations. 3DGS takes a fundamentally different approach by representing scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian functions, each describing a small "splat" of color and opacity in 3D space.

### Key Advantages

- **Real-time Performance**: Renders at interactive frame rates
- **Photorealistic Quality**: Maintains high visual fidelity
- **View-dependent Effects**: Naturally handles reflections and lighting
- **Efficient Storage**: Compact representation of complex scenes

## Mathematical Foundation

### 3D Gaussian Functions

At its core, each Gaussian splat is defined by:

<div class="math-block">
\[
G(\mathbf{x}) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})\right)
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mu}\)</span> is the 3D position (mean)
- <span class="math-inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\)</span> is the 3×3 covariance matrix
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is any point in 3D space

### Covariance Matrix Decomposition

The covariance matrix <span class="math-inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\)</span> is decomposed into:

<div class="math-block">
\[
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{S}^T \mathbf{R}^T
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is a rotation matrix (3×3)
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is a scaling matrix (3×3 diagonal)

This decomposition allows independent control over:
- **Position** (<span class="math-inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mu}\)</span>): Where the Gaussian is located
- **Rotation** (<span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>): How it's oriented in space
- **Scale** (<span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span>): Its size along each axis

### Spherical Harmonics

Color information is encoded using spherical harmonics (SH), allowing view-dependent appearance:

<div class="math-block">
\[
C(\mathbf{d}) = \sum_{l=0}^{L} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} c_l^m \cdot Y_l^m(\mathbf{d})
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{d}\)</span> is the viewing direction
- <span class="math-inline">\(c_l^m\)</span> are the SH coefficients
- <span class="math-inline">\(Y_l^m\)</span> are the spherical harmonic basis functions

## Rendering Pipeline

### 1. Projection to 2D

Each 3D Gaussian is projected to screen space using the camera parameters:

<div class="math-block">
\[
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}' = \mathbf{J} \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{J}^T
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span> is the Jacobian of the projection
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathbf{W}\)</span> is the world-to-camera transformation

### 2. Alpha Blending

Gaussians are sorted by depth and blended using:

<div class="math-block">
\[
C = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \cdot \alpha_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i-1} (1 - \alpha_j)
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(c_i\)</span> is the color of Gaussian i
- <span class="math-inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> is its alpha value
- The product term handles occlusion

### 3. Optimization

The system is trained end-to-end using gradient descent on:

<div class="math-block">
\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{color}} + \lambda_{\text{ssim}} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{ssim}}
\]
</div>

Where:
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{color}}\)</span> is the L1 color loss
- <span class="math-inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{ssim}}\)</span> is the structural similarity loss
- <span class="math-inline">\(\lambda_{\text{ssim}}\)</span> balances the two terms

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Management

Each Gaussian requires storage for:
- Position: 3 floats (12 bytes)
- Rotation: 4 floats (16 bytes, quaternion)
- Scale: 3 floats (12 bytes)
- Opacity: 1 float (4 bytes)
- SH coefficients: 48 floats (192 bytes, degree 3)

Total: ~236 bytes per Gaussian

### GPU Optimization

Efficient rendering requires:
- **Tile-based rendering**: Divide screen into tiles
- **Frustum culling**: Skip invisible Gaussians
- **Level-of-detail**: Reduce complexity at distance
- **Memory coalescing**: Optimize GPU memory access

## Practical Applications

### Scene Reconstruction

3DGS excels at reconstructing scenes from:
- Multi-view photographs
- Video sequences
- LIDAR point clouds
- Photogrammetry data

### Real-time Rendering

Applications include:
- **Virtual Reality**: Immersive environments
- **Gaming**: Photorealistic backgrounds
- **Architecture**: Walkthrough visualizations
- **Film**: Digital set extensions

## Limitations and Challenges

### Current Limitations

- **Dynamic scenes**: Limited support for moving objects
- **Transparency**: Complex transparent materials are challenging
- **Editing**: Difficult to modify reconstructed scenes
- **Storage**: Large datasets require significant memory

### Active Research Areas

- **Temporal consistency**: Handling video sequences
- **Semantic understanding**: Object-level editing
- **Compression**: Reducing storage requirements
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining with traditional rendering
