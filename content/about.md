# About SkySplat: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Blender

SkySplat is an open-source initiative dedicated to making **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** technology accessible to artists, researchers, and developers worldwide. We started with a vision: bring drone-based video and aerial photogrammetry to 3DGS entirely within the Blender 3D viewport. Our core mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge Gaussian splatting research and practical creative tools for Blender users.

## What is 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)?

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a revolutionary neural rendering technique for real-time photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional polygon mesh rendering or NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields), 3DGS represents scenes as collections of 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling:

- **Real-time Rendering**: Photorealistic quality at 60+ FPS
- **Novel View Synthesis**: Generate new camera perspectives from sparse drone footage or photos
- **Efficient Workflow**: Seamless integration with COLMAP structure-from-motion
- **Blender Native**: Work directly in Blender's familiar 3D viewport
- **Drone Photogrammetry**: Ideal for processing aerial and ground-based captures
- **Compact Storage**: Efficient representation for streaming and distribution

## Our Projects

### SkySplat Blender Addon
Our flagship project is a comprehensive Blender addon that brings the complete 3D Gaussian Splatting workflow into Blender. Perfect for drone operators, 3D artists, and researchers working with photogrammetry and neural rendering. Features include:

- **Video Processing**: Load drone footage and extract frames for 3DGS training
- **COLMAP Integration**: Configure and run structure-from-motion directly in Blender
- **Point Cloud Editing**: Import, scale, rotate, and transform COLMAP reconstructions
- **Camera Management**: Visualize and adjust camera positions from photogrammetry
- **Brush Training**: Configure and run [Brush](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush), a high-performance Rust-based 3DGS training engine
- **Real-time Preview**: View Gaussian splatting results in Blender's viewport

### Future Projects
We are actively *exploring* (not yet developing necessarily) these future projects to advanced the state of the art - 
- 3DGS support native to Blender - I gave a [talk about this at bcon25](https://youtu.be/gU8oR7vqfRg?si=5s5JSeQkmGtwRvwE&t=3637) and look forward to exploring this more 
- SkySplat CLI - I think there is huge potential for a CLI "shell" that provides smart interactions between all of the emerging 3DGS technologies

## Community

SkySplat is built by and for the community. We believe in:
